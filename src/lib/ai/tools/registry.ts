/**
 * Typed app-tool framework (PRD-phase-2 §3.3 "the app-control surface").
 *
 * This module owns the *framework*: the `ToolContext` Koji's tools run against,
 * the `AppTool` shape, and the `defineTool` identity helper. The §3.3 catalog
 * itself (goToLesson / resumeLesson, giveHint, explainMiss, generatePractice,
 * setDifficulty, readProgress, revealSolution, celebrate) lives in sibling files
 * and is collected into the `appTools` array by `./index`. Every tool is
 * Zod-validated so the agent's arguments are checked before a handler runs (P3).
 *
 * The `ToolContext` is deliberately UI-framework-agnostic: it is a set of plain
 * interfaces (no JSX, no React, no router types) so the lesson player, the text
 * agent, and the realtime voice agent can each construct one and the same tools
 * drive all three surfaces.
